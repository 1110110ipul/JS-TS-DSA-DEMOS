# JS-TS-DSA-DEMOS

This repository contains **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, and **JS application** demos.

We have created separate **JS** and **TS** folders to write demo functions in both JavaScript and TypeScript, allowing us to implement and test the functions in both languages.

## Execution Instructions:

- To run the **JavaScript** code, use:  
  ```bash
  node foldername.js

- To run the **TypeScript** code, use:  
  ```bash
  bun foldername.js
